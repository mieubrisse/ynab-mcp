# YNAB MCP Server

An MCP server for YNAB with batch operations, deterministic analysis tools, and robust undo support.

> **This is a fork.** It diverges from upstream `Maronato/ynab-mcp` in three
> ways that matter, all driven by running against a real budget:
>
> - **No filesystem access.** Undo history is held in memory and the
>   methodology documents are compiled in, so the server needs no read, write
>   or home-directory access. It runs with network access to `api.ynab.com`
>   and nothing else, which is what bounds the blast radius of every
>   dependency in the tree. The trade: undo history does not survive a
>   restart.
> - **Editing a split's category or subtransactions is refused.** YNAB has no
>   way to do it in place; the only mechanism is delete-and-recreate, which
>   cannot be undone, changes the transaction id, and severs the link to the
>   imported bank record. That is a deletion, and it should not happen inside
>   a routine batch update.
> - **Split parts are checked locally** before a request is spent, and the
>   error names both totals.
>
> The token variable is `YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` here, not `YNAB_API_TOKEN`.


> [!NOTE]
> **AI Disclosure:** This project was built with Claude Code and Cursor. It works and is tested, but the code is largely clanker-made.

## Highlights

- **26 tools** covering budgets, accounts, transactions, categories, targets, scheduled transactions, and spending analysis
- **Deterministic analysis** — spending aggregation, trends, income vs expense, recurring-charge and anomaly detection, and a one-call budget health snapshot. Judgment calls (forecasting, reallocation, prioritization) are deliberately left to the calling agent, which has the exact data and more context
- **Batch operations** — create, update, and delete multiple transactions in a single call, with per-item API costs documented where the YNAB API has no bulk endpoint
- **Undo support** — every write operation is recorded and reversible
- **Smart categorization** — transaction category suggestions from payee history and scheduled-transaction matching, with confidence gating so only high-confidence suggestions land in the ready-to-apply actions
- **Built-in knowledge base** — YNAB methodology docs (credit cards, targets, overspending, reconciliation) served as MCP resources
- **5 workflow prompts** — monthly reviews, spending reports, unapproved triage, budget optimization, and subscription audits
- **Read-only mode** — write tools are not even registered, so clients only see tools they can use
- **Efficient caching** — delta sync with YNAB's server knowledge system, configurable TTLs, and client-side rate-limit tracking

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- A YNAB [personal access token](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer)

### Usage

Run directly with `npx`:

```bash
YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token npx @maro-org/ynab-mcp
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @maro-org/ynab-mcp
YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token ynab-mcp
```

### MCP Client Configuration

Add the server to your MCP client config. For example, in Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ynab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@maro-org/ynab-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Cursor, add the same structure to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally.

## Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables.

### Spending Analysis & Diagnostics

| Tool                         | Description                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get_spending_analysis`      | Spending aggregates by category/payee with top-N ranking; optional `time_granularity` buckets spending over time   |
| `get_spending_trends`        | Multi-month time series by category, payee, or group; the partial current month is marked and excluded from trends |
| `get_income_expense_summary` | Income vs expense totals with savings rate; partial current month excluded from averages                           |

| `detect_recurring_charges`   | Subscription and recurring charge detection from transaction history                                               |

| `get_money_movements`        | Audit feed of budget moves between categories or Ready to Assign, including moves made in the YNAB apps            |

All analysis tools are deterministic — no LLM sampling involved. They report facts and clearly-labeled statistical estimates; forecasting and reallocation decisions are left to the calling agent (the workflow prompts walk it through that reasoning using `get_targets`, `get_monthly_budget`, and `get_scheduled_transactions`).

### Scheduled Transactions

| Tool                            | Description                                                                  |

| `update_scheduled_transactions` | Batch update scheduled transactions (one API call per item)                  |
| `delete_scheduled_transactions` | Batch delete scheduled transactions (one API call per item)                  |

### Smart Tools

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suggest_transaction_categories` | Suggest categories for uncategorized transactions based on payee history and patterns |

Suggestions carry confidence levels; only those at or above `action_confidence` (default `high`) are included in the ready-to-apply `update_actions`, and approval is opt-in.

### Undo

| Tool                | Description                                      |

## Key Concepts

**Currency units** — All monetary amounts in tool inputs and outputs use standard currency units (e.g., `12.50`), not YNAB's native milliunits. Most tools also echo a top-level `currency` ISO code; `get_spending_analysis` additionally reports raw `*_milliunits` totals alongside them.

**`budget_id`** — Most tools accept an optional `budget_id`. Omit it or pass `"last-used"` to target the most recently accessed budget.

**Undo** — Every write operation records an undo entry. Use `list_undo_history` and `undo_operations` to review or revert changes. The most recent 2000 entries per budget are kept (tunable via `YNAB_UNDO_HISTORY_LIMIT`). History lives in memory only, so it is scoped to a single server process and does not survive a restart.

**Read-only mode** — Set `YNAB_READ_ONLY=true` to hide and block all write operations. Useful for exploring your budget safely or restricting an MCP client to read-only access.

**Rate limiting** — The YNAB API allows 200 requests per rolling hour. The server tracks usage locally and reports when capacity frees up if the limit is reached. (The API used to expose an `X-Rate-Limit` header the tracker reconciled against; the live API no longer sends it, so the local tracker is the sole signal until a 429 confirms exhaustion.) Tools that cost one API call per item say so in their descriptions.
